  answer: `Yes, in a motor accident claim under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, where the deceased was self-employed and aged 54–55 years at the time of death, the claimant **is entitled to an addition towards future prospects**.

### Legal Position:

The **Punjab and Haryana High Court**, in _Dani Devi v. Pritam Singh_ (FAO No. 4353 of 2012, decided on 13.09.2022), held that:

> "...as the age of the deceased at the time of accident was held to be about 54–55 years, being self-employed, **10% of annual income should have been awarded on account of future prospects.**"  
> [Para 7, citing _National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi_ (2017) and _Sarla Verma v. DTC_ (2009)]

---

### Summary of Entitlement:

- **Category:** Self-employed  
- **Age:** 54–55 years  
- **Future Prospects Addition:** **10%** of the annual income

---

This is consistent with the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in _Pranay Sethi_, where future prospects were allowed even for self-employed and fixed-income individuals, based on age bands.`,
